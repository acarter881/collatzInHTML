<h4>
    The Collatz conjecture (a.k.a. the 3n + 1 problem) is, as of <time datetime="2020-10-24">Saturday, October 24<sup>th</sup>, 2020</time>, an unsolved math problem.
</h4>
<p>
    The Collatz conjecture takes any positive integer <var>n</var> and does one of two actions to it:<br><br>
    If <var>n</var> is even, divides <var>n</var> by 2.<br>
    If <var>n</var> is odd, multiplies <var>n</var> by 3 and adds 1.<br><br>
    Repeating this process for the return value of each previous iteration eventually results in a final output of 1.<br>
    Laypeople may think that following the <abbr title="Keep It Simple Stupid">KISS</abbr> method would be enough to solve this math problem, but that is NOT the case.
</p>
<p>
    For example, let's assume <var>n</var> is equal to 12:<br><br>
    Since 12 is an even number, we'll divide <var>n</var> by 2, to get 6.<br>
    Since 6 is also an even number, we'll divide 6 by 2, to get 3.<br>
    Since 3 is an odd number, we'll multiply 3 times 3 and add 1, to get 10.<br>
    Since 10 is an even number, we'll divide 10 by 2, to get 5.<br>
    Since 5 is an odd number, we'll multiply 5 times 3 and add 1, to get 16.<br>
    Since 16 is an even number, we'll divide 16 by 2, to get 8.<br>
    Since 8 is an even number, we'll divide 8 by 2, to get 4.<br>
    Since 4 is an even number, we'll divide 4 by 2, to get 2.<br>
    Since 2 is an even number, we'll divide 2 by 2, to get 1.<br><br>
    The Collatz conjecture takes 9 iterations to go from 12 to 1.

<h4>
    Using Python to figure out the iterations it takes for a positive integer <var>n</var> to get to 1.
</h4>

<p>
    The code at the bottom of the page starts off by defining a function called <var>collatz</var> which takes a single input (an integer <var>n</var>).<br>
    When the program is run, the user is prompted to input a positive integer; this integer is stored in the <var>user_number</var> variable.<br>
    After this, the program runs until the return value of <var>collatz(user_number)</var> is equal to 1, printing <var>n</var> and the return value for each iteration from <var>n</var> to 1, inclusive.<br>
    The final output of the program is a line of text that tells you the number of iterations required to convert <var>n</var> to 1.
</p>

<div>If the user inputs <kbd>12</kbd> for the value of <var>n</var>, the program's output will be as follows:</div>

<pre>
    <samp>
    Please input a positive integer: 
    12
    6
    3
    10
    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1
    The number of iterations is: 9
    </samp>
</pre>

<h4>The Python Code:</h4>

<pre><code>def collatz(n):
if n % 2 == 0:
    return n // 2
return 3 * n + 1

while 1:
    try:
        user_number = int(input('Please input a positive integer: \n'))
        if user_number < 1:
            continue
        break
    except ValueError:
        continue

iter = 0

while 1:
    iter += 1
    if collatz(user_number) == 1:
        print(1)
        break
    print(collatz(user_number))
    user_number = collatz(user_number)

print('The number of iterations is: ' + str(iter))
